# MagSlide

MagSlide is a basic puzzle/platformer for Android.

Each level has two parts.

First, move the blocks by tilting your Android device to form a path to the exit.

Next, when you're ready, press Ready to gain control of your character and make for the exit.

If you made a mistake, you can hit 'Retry'; you get 3 retries.

Certain blocks have special abilities; blocks can rotate, be frozen in place, or destroyed. 

A playable demo: (you will need to enable "Unknown Sources" and hit OK on a couple of Google Play Security Screens as this is not tied to a Developer Account)
